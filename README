How to use BHColourPicker
Installation
Download the most recent source.
Unzip the archive. You will find two directories inside: BHColourPicker and ColourPickerHarness_Sample. ColourPickerHarness_Sample is just an example project; you don't need it.
Drag the BHColourPicker folder into your project.
Your code
To show the colour picker, use code something like the following:

    //  since it has 'new' in the method name, you own it...
    BHColourPickerController *vc = [BHColourPickerController newColourPickerController];
    vc.delegate = self;                    // the delegate
    vc.colour = self.view.backgroundColor; // the initial colour
    vc.titleText = @"Some kind of title";  // title to display
    [self presentModalViewController:vc animated:YES];
    [vc release];   //  ...and must release it
You must implement the BHColourPickerControllerDelegate protocol in one of your objects. Implement the following two methods (with examples):

- (void)colourPickerControllerDidCancel:(BHColourPickerController *)controller
{
    // the user just cancelled it; put the picker away
    [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES];
}

- (void)colourPickerController:(BHColourPickerController *)controller didFinishPickingColour:(UIColor *)colour
{
    // the user confirmed a colour; do something with it
    self.view.backgroundColor = colour;
    // and put the picker away
    [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES];
}
